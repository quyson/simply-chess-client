## Simply Chess
This repository contains a simple web-based Chess application built using React, Node.js, Socket.IO, and the chess.js library. The application allows users to play Chess in real-time with another player. It includes features such as creating a new game, joining an existing game, making moves, and handling game outcomes.

## Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
Socket.IO: A library for enabling real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication.
chess.js: A JavaScript chess library for chess move generation, validation, and more.
react-chessboard: A React component for rendering a chessboard.

## Application Structure
The project is organized into three main components:

App Component (App.tsx):
Manages the overall application structure, routing, and renders different components based on routes.

ChessLogic Component (ChessLogic.tsx):
Manages the game logic, including moves, turns, and game outcomes.
Uses the chess.js library to represent and manipulate the game state.
Communicates with the server using Socket.IO for real-time updates.

ChessRoom Component (ChessRoom.tsx):
Handles the setup of the game, including creating and joining game rooms.
Manages the connection to the Socket.IO server and handles events like creating new games, joining games, and starting games.

## Additional Notes
The application uses Socket.IO for real-time communication between players. Ensure that the server is running and accessible for proper functionality.
Feel free to explore and modify the code to add more features, improve functionality, or customize the UI.
Enjoy playing Chess in this simple web application!
